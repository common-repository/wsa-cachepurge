The Website Accelerator by Astral Internet is a tool that allows you to place certain elements of a site in buffer memory (cache) inside the server. Once the elements are placed buffer of the server, they can be served much faster to people viewing a website.
The website accelerator maximizes the Nginx caching feature while offering granular configuration for each site. More information concerning the WSA module is available on this blog “[No more slow websites!]( https://www.astralinternet.com/blog/en/no-more-slow-websites/)”.
